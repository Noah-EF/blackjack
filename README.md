# blackjack
Blackjack game made in Python by Noah Flanagan
Started in Fall 2021 as part of a class

The different versions (blackjack01, blackjack02, ...) are different versions of the program. I did not origionally make this project with Github so that was my version control.

I chose this project because while a bare-bones blackjack game is relatively simple, there are many additional features that can be added. The current version does function as a simple version of blackjack. I have also been working on a data recording/analysis system. This system records past games and can report basic statistics such as win/loss rates. Another idea I have is to train a ML model based on the data from the game. While this is not necessary because computers already exist which can play perfectly, it would be a good learning project.

Feature Progress
Completed Features: Deck nonreplacement, input error resilience, proper ace coding (Ace is 1 or 11), record results as JSON file
In progress: results reporting/analysis, help menu
Planned: custom rules, better dealer play (including difficulty settings), splitting, betting, GUI instead of command line UI
